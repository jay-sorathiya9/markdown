1. Headers (Size)
Use the hash symbol # followed by a space. The more hashes, the smaller the header.

# Heading 1 → <h1>

## Heading 2 → <h2>

### Heading 3 → <h3>

2. Text Styling
Use symbols to wrap your text.

Bold: **text** or __text__

Italic: *text* or _text_

~~Strikethrough:~~ ~~text~~

Combined: ***text***

3. Lists
Unordered: Use a dash -, plus +, or asterisk *.

Markdown

- Item 1
- Item 2
Ordered: Use numbers followed by a period.

Markdown

1. First item
2. Second item
4. Code Blocks
Essential for developers!

Inline Code: Wrap text in a single backtick `code`.

Fenced Code Blocks: Wrap multiple lines in triple backticks. <pre>

JavaScript

console.log(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
</pre>

5. Links & Images
Links: [Title](URL) → [Google](https://google.com)

Images: ![Alt Text](ImageURL) → ![Logo](https://example.com/logo.png)

6. Blockquotes & Rules
Blockquote: Use the > symbol.

This is a quote.

Horizontal Rule: Use three dashes --- on a new line.

Pro-Tip for your Code
If you want your editor to support Tables or Task Lists, make sure your marked.js library is configured correctly. By default, it supports most of these "GitHub Flavored" features.

Would you like me to show you how to add a "Copy to Clipboard" button so people can easily grab their finished HTML?
